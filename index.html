 <strong>Dear Rita</strong>
 <p>
I've Wanted To Say This A Long Time Ago But I Couldn't So I Decided To Make This For You About My Feeling For You,
You Have Been With Me Everyday And I Thank You For It But It's Time For Me To Tell You That's You're The Most Beautiful And Cutest Person I Know,
I Like Your Personality You're Hair You're Eyes You're Shortness :) You're Craziness And Mostly You're Smile,
I Hope Nothing Will Happen Beetween Us.
